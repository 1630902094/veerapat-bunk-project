    <p>Welcome to this book! We’re delighted to have this opportunity to convey the
        excitement of the world of computer systems. Th is is not a dry and dreary fi eld,
        where progress is glacial and where new ideas atrophy from neglect. No! Computers
        are the product of the incredibly vibrant information technology industry, all
        aspects of which are responsible for almost 10% of the gross national product of
        the United States, and whose economy has become dependent in part on the rapid
        improvements in information technology promised by Moore’s Law. Th is unusual
        industry embraces innovation at a breath-taking rate. In the last 30 years, there have
        been a number of new computers whose introduction appeared to revolutionize
        the computing industry; these revolutions were cut short only because someone
        else built an even better computer.</p>
