    <p>This race to innovate has led to unprecedented progress since the inception
        of electronic computing in the late 1940s. Had the transportation industry kept
        pace with the computer industry, for example, today we could travel from New
        York to London in a second for a penny. Take just a moment to contemplate how
        such an improvement would change society—living in Tahiti while working in San
        Francisco, going to Moscow for an evening at the Bolshoi Ballet—and you can
        appreciate the implications of such a change.</p>
